## Flaming Tower

Developed by group 11 at NTNU Ã…lesund computer engineering 3rd year.

## The game

The goal of our game is to make the main character of the story climb the tower by jumping up using platforms. The challenge here is that lava will ascend the second the character jumps. The difficulty increases as the character climbs up the tower. The higher the character climbs, the more challenges will appear. Lava speed increases, greater distances between the platforms and so on.
